## Introduction

Welcome to Trinsic, the proof-of-anything platform. We are the leading developer platform for implementing [verifiable credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) and [decentralized identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) - emerging web standards for building next-gen digital identity systems.

Learn how to issue and verify universally-accepted digital credentials so that anywhere people go online or in-person, they can simply tap their phone, prove who they are, and get what they need.

## Getting Started
