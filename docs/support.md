# Have a Question? 

Normally, the best way to ask quick questions is through the [Trinsic Community slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/trinsiccommunity/shared_invite/zt-pcsdy7kn-h4vtdPEpqQUlmirU8FFzSQ).

If you have a bug to report, please report it on the Github issues on our SDK. Contributions and additions to this docs site are always welcome.

Finally, if you're interested in getting in touch with the team for any other reason, contact us at [support@trinsic.id](mailto:support@trinsic.id). We treat any feedback as gold.
