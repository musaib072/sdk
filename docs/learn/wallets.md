# Wallets

Wallets can be thought of a little like an email inbox. Wallets exist to send, receive and store credentials. Wallets can be hosted by anyone. Each wallet can only be accessed by a set of keys stored on devices.
Wallets represent a user's identity. They manage an identity for an individual. 
Trinsic has a wallet that is built to be eventually interoperable with other identity wallets that exist.
