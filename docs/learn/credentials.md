# Credentials
Organizations and governments across the world have converged on a digital identity document standard called Verifiable Credentials.

Trinsic's platform covers the full credential lifecycle. Our tools help you create, issue, verify, revoke, and store these credentials. These pieces are meant to be modular and interoperable.

Verifiable Credentials are a way of representing documents online that make them interoperable and instantly verifiable. In its technical sense, a credential is a set of one or more cryptographically verifiable assertions about a subject made by an entity.

Just like passports and drivers licenses today have interoperability components like their barcode, credentials have the same feature but are built into the internet itself, and can be used anywhere it is supported. Our tools let you choose to support the standard. By following the verifiable credential standard, your organization can issue digital documents that can be verified anywhere.
