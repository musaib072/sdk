# Introduction

## Welcome to Trinsic
Trinsic is a developer platform to exchange verifiable credentials.

Verifiable Credentials transform credentials, licenses, passes, and certificates into a W3C standard format that can be exchanged digitally and verified instantly. Unlike a paper document or html form, when information from a verifiable credential is shared, it can be instantly proven to be authentic.

They require no centralized authority or proprietary technology to use - verifiable credentials are built on interoperable standards  designed to be open, privacy-preserving, and distributed like the internet itself.

Hundreds of organizations of all sizes and industries use Trinsicâ€™s infrastructure and tools to instantly verify information about individuals with technology instead of paper.
